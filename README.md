# EIP-5630 JavaScript Implementation

This repository gives a basic JavaScript implementation of the 2 functions defined in [EIP-5630](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5630): `eth_getEncryptionPublicKey` and `eth_decrypt`. This code is for testing purposes only and shouldn't be used in production. It is mainly used as a stopgap for local testing until the most popular wallets implement the proposal. **DO NOT CALL THESE FUNCTIONS WITH YOUR PERSONAL PRIVATE KEY.**
